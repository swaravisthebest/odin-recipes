    <p>Gulab jamun is a popular South Asian dessert, particularly in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh.
         It consists of deep-fried balls made from milk solids (traditionally khoya, but often using dried or powdered milk in modern recipes) and flour, then soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup flavored with cardamom and rose water or kewra.
          The name "Gulab Jamun" translates to "rose berry," with "gulab" referring to the rose-water scented syrup and "jamun" to a type of berry.
         These soft, spongy, and sweet balls are a beloved treat, often enjoyed during festivals and celebrations.</p>
